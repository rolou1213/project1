Welcome to my game, **Save Pikachu**, A hangman inspired game.

- Hangman is a simple word guessing game. Players try to figure out an unknown word by guessing letters. If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (loses).

**Save Pikachu**, as a word guessing game that similar to Hangman. Each time, when you get the word letters wrong, the timer of the bomb will be ticking, To keep Pikachu from being hit by a bomb, you must guess the secret word one letter at a time without the bomb timer going off.

The theme, the background image, music and fonts are all from the greatest show Pokemon.

- Here are some screenshot of the game

As you can see below, the screenshot shows the UI of the game. Player can hover to the rules, and the rules of the game will show up. Player can also turn on/off the background music.

- Next Steps: 

 One of the most important feature i would like to add to this game is to let the player choose the word category. In that case, user will be enjoy the game based on the category of their selection.

Also, I would also like to integrate more animations when the bomb timer is getting close to 0. 

The 2.0 version of **Save Pikachu** will be adding the sound affect to each button. The game will also have the ability to capture player name, and their record.
